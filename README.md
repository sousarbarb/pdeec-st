# Multivariable Control

This repository contains the work developed by being a teaching
assistant (TA) in the scope of the course Special Topics of the doctoral program
in Electrical and Computers Engineering (ECE) at the Faculty of Engineering of
the University of Porto (FEUP).

The main goal of the TA activity was to present a new concept to the students of
Industrial Robotics (course of the masters in ECE @ FEUP): multivariable
control. All the documentation and all the source code (MATLAB + SimTwo, with
the latter being the simulator used in the course) are present in the folders
`doc/` and `src/`, respectively.

## Usage

1. Go to the folder `src/SimTwoRINDScara_V24April2021/`
2. Open the executable `SimTwo2020.exe` (only compatible with Windows)
3. Change the scene if it is not present a SCARA robot manipulator (`Ctrl + N` >
   Select `ScaraPlotterPDEECSTStudents.scene` > Press `OK`)
4. Acees the sheet (`Ctrl + H`) and interact with the simulation
